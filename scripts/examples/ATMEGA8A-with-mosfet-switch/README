What is it
----------

 This directory contains all of the files required to simulate a transient
 response of the circuit in NGSpice which is built on ATmega8A microcontroller
 which generates a PWM signal and toggles a 12V mosfet switch.

How to run this example
-----------------------

 Start NGSpice in interactive mode from the current directory, load MCUSim
 code model library (mcusim.cm) and perform a simulation:

        ngspice -> codemodel <PATH_TO_LIBRARY>/mcusim.cm
        ngspice -> pb3-pwm.cir

 It'll take some time and ~458851 data rows should be generated.
