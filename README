MCUSim
======
Simulator for microcontrollers is a set of programs used to run ROM files
which are intended to be loaded directly into the integrated circuits.

MCUSim is under active development and not ready to be used by the end users.

Synopsis
--------
	avrsim -m model -p program

Supported MCUs
--------------
	- AVR
		- ATmega8A	(mcusim/avr/sim/simm8a.h)
		- ATmega328P	(mcusim/avr/sim/simm328p.h)
		- ATmega328	(mcusim/avr/sim/simm328.h)
		- ATmega2560	(mcusim/avr/sim/simm2560.h)

Options
-------
	Simulator Configuration
		-m model
			Select an MCU model to simulate. See Models.txt to
			obtain exact values.
		-p program
			Load specified program from an Intel HEX file.
			See samples/avr-progmem.hex for details.

Commands
--------
	step, next, stepi, nexti, si, ni, s, n
		Execute next instruction.

	step N
		Execute next N instructions.

	until ADDR
		Execute instructions until the given address in form 0xABCD.
		Last executed instruction is placed at ADDR.

	where
		Show next instruction.

	run, r
		Start execution of the program.

	set listsize N
		Show N instructions during the next call to the 'list' command.

	show listsize
		Show current number of instruction to show during the
		'list' command.

	list, l
		Show next N instructions.

Roadmap
-------
	- AVR
		- [?] CPU: AVR, AVRe, AVRxm (without DES), AVRxt, AVRrc
		- [x] Register File, I/O Registers, Internal SRAM
		- [ ] Interrupts, internal and external
		- [?] Boot Loader
		- [ ] EEPROM
		- [ ] MCUs with 22-bit PC
		- [ ] 8-bit Timers/Counters
		- [ ] 16-bit Timers/Counters

	- Ideas
		- Simulation of the AVR-based schematic using SPICE, maybe
		- Support other popular MCUs (PIC by Microchip, 16-bit and
		  32-bit MCUs by Texas Instruments)

Build
-----
	- Make sure you have installed CMake build system version 3.2
	  or above. It is used to prepare makefiles (or other build files)
	  for many platforms and environments. Installed version can be
	  checked by a command running in your terminal:

		cmake --version

	- ANSI C compiler

	- If you have all of these programs above installed:

		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
