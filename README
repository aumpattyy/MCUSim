MCUSim
======
Simulator for microcontrollers is a set of programs used to run ROM files
which are intended to be loaded directly into the integrated circuits.

MCUSim is under active development and not ready to be used by the end users.

Synopsis
--------
	avrsim -p partno -U memtype:op:filename

Supported MCUs
--------------
	- AVR
		- ATmega8A	(mcusim/avr/sim/simm8a.h)
		- ATmega328P	(mcusim/avr/sim/simm328p.h)
		- ATmega328	(mcusim/avr/sim/simm328.h)
		- ATmega2560	(mcusim/avr/sim/simm2560.h)

Build
-----
	- ANSI C compiler

	- Make sure you have installed CMake build system version 3.2
	  or above. It is used to prepare makefiles (or other build files)
	  for many platforms and environments. Installed version can be
	  checked by a command running in your terminal:

		cmake --version

	- If you have all of these programs above installed:

		mkdir out && cd out
		cmake ..
		make
		make install

	  The last command may fail due to the lack of write permission to the
	  /usr directory. Try to run it as a superuser:

		su
		make install
		exit

	- Note that you will be able to display manual pages using:

		man avrsim

Roadmap
-------
	- AVR
		- [?] CPU: AVR, AVRe, AVRxm (without DES), AVRxt, AVRrc
		- [x] Register File, I/O Registers, Internal SRAM
		- [ ] Interrupts, internal and external
		- [?] Boot Loader
		- [ ] EEPROM
		- [ ] MCUs with 22-bit PC
		- [ ] 8-bit Timers/Counters
		- [ ] 16-bit Timers/Counters

	- Ideas
		- Simulation of the AVR-based schematic using SPICE, maybe
		- Support other popular MCUs (PIC by Microchip, 16-bit and
		  32-bit MCUs by Texas Instruments)
