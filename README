Readme for MCUSim
=================

 MCUSim is a digital simulator of the 8-bit AVR microcontrollers. It is
 written from scratch to assist in circuit simulation, firmware debugging,
 testing, and signal tracing.

 There is a configuration file "mcusim.conf" which is installed together with
 the "mcusim" binary and "libmsim.a" library and can be used to tweak
 a behavior of the simulator. It is carefully documented and the best way to
 prepare your own simulation is to copy mcusim.conf to a new directory, adjust
 the options and run mcusim. Firmware and Lua files can be placed in the same
 working directory to be referenced by the relative paths, for instance.

 Script files written in Lua can be used to represent models of the real
 devices during a simulation process. They may affect state of an MCU in
 several ways, e.g. access internal registers, generate signals on its pins or
 terminate the whole simulation, and play roles of the significant parts of a
 circuit connected to the microcontroller (external EEPROM, humidity sensor,
 MOSFET switch, etc).

 Registers of a simulated MCU can be saved into a VCD (value change dump)
 file and read using GTKWave viewer.

How can I start a discussion?
-----------------------------

 Feel free to ask questions and start a discussion in the mailing lists for
 users or developers. There are no specific rules which one to choose, so
 subscribe and send a letter.

How can I join the development?
-------------------------------

 To join the development just code the feature you want to add and send
 your patch to the mailing list. Before you start coding check the latest
 development release of MCUSim from our git repository or try to find a
 ticket at https://trac.mcusim.org/report. It might be that your feature has
 already been implemented.

 There is no bureaucracy here.

Mailing lists
-------------

 There are three mailing lists dedicated to the announces, use and development
 of MCUSim.

 * mcusim-announce@mcusim.org:
   MCUSim announces. Subscribe to stay informed about new versions,
   release notes, etc.

 * mcusim@mcusim.org:
   This is a list for the users of the MCUSim simulator.

 * mcusim-dev@mcusim.org:
   This is a list for developers and "want to be" developers. Subscribe to
   discuss any development issues and share patches.

 To subscribe the list(s), send a message to:
   <mcusim-announce-subscribe@mcusim.org>
   <mcusim-subscribe@mcusim.org>
   <mcusim-dev-subscribe@mcusim.org>

 To unsubscribe from the list(s), send a message to:
   <mcusim-announce-unsubscribe@mcusim.org>
   <mcusim-unsubscribe@mcusim.org>
   <mcusim-dev-unsubscribe@mcusim.org>
