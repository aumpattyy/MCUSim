Simulated boards
================
Each board is a pair of configured MCU and a set of peripherals backed by
the script modules written in Lua. These boards are destributed with MCUSim
to describe a specific aspect or test some features of the simulator.

Board itself can be created and configured by
[make-board.sh](https://github.com/dsalychev/mcusim/blob/master/scripts/make-board.sh)
script.
